Usage:
------
gliar <opengl_executable>

The library will read the gliar.conf file in the user's library directory or
the .gliar.conf file in the user's home directory.

Example gliar.conf:
-------------------
[key1]
value1
value2
.
.
.
valueN

[key2]
value1
.
.
.
valueN

[keyN]
value1
.
.
.
valueN

Note: The library can only restrict the capabilities of a GPU, not "emulate" non supported extensions for 
example. If the gliar.conf contains an extension that is not supported by the user's real GPU, the library 
will return a warning and the user's program might crash.
