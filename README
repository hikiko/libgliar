Usage:
------
gliar <opengl_executable>

The library will read the gliar.conf file in the user's library directory or
the .gliar.conf file in the user's home directory.

Example gliar.conf:
-------------------
[key1]
value1
value2
.
.
.
valueN

[key2]
value1
.
.
.
valueN

[keyN]
value1
.
.
.
valueN

Currently supported keys:
"vendor" (the vendor string), "extensions" (the list of the extensions), "version" (the opengl version string),
"sl version" (the shading language version), "renderer" (the renderer), "max texture units", "max texture size"

Example configuration files can be found in the directory examples.

Note: The library can only restrict the capabilities of a GPU, not "emulate" non supported extensions for 
example. If the gliar.conf contains an extension that is not supported by the user's real GPU, the library 
will return a warning and the user's program might crash.
